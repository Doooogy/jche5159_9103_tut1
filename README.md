Methods: User Input
There are three stages in this project, representing the beginning, decay and rebirth of fate.

* **Stage 1:**
  Users control the image movement and music playback speed by moving the mouse horizontally, which means controlling fate.

* **Stage 2:**
  Users press the mouse to influence the Canvas, which means the butterfly effect caused by different choices in fate.

* **Stage 3:**
  The increasing and randomly moving images represent the occurrence of the multiverse.


## Inspiration:
### Wheels of fortune
We selected Pacita Abad's 'Wheels of fortune' as our inspiration image. Pacitaâ€™s works contain her thoughts on fate. She is an outstanding female writer in the Philippines. Her travels in Asia deeply inspired her, so combined with the ancient Chinese Dunhuang culture, I hope to show the theme of the ups and downs of fate.

### Starfield Simulation
Through the visualization simulation of the starry sky and warp speed, a visual effect of things coming towards you is presented.

* Defines a dot and a circle object that can be updated and displayed on a canvas. The update() method moves them based on its depth (z), and then displays the dots and its trail on the canvas.
  
```
   display() {
    fill(231, 231, 224); // Set fill color
    noStroke(); // Disable stroke

    let sx = map(this.x / this.z, 0, 1, 0, width); // Map x to screen
    let sy = map(this.y / this.z, 0, 1, 0, height); // Map y to screen
    let r = map(this.z, 0, width, dotSize, 0); // Map radius
    ellipse(sx, sy, r, r); // Draw dot

    let px = map(this.x / this.pz, 0, 1, 0, width); // Map previous x to screen
    let py = map(this.y / this.pz, 0, 1, 0, height); // Map previous y to screen

    this.pz = this.z; // Update previous z-coordinate

    stroke(193, 110, 74); // Set stroke color
    line(px, py, sx, sy); // Draw line}

```

### Ink Drops
Use marbling colour to simulate ink dripping when the mouse is pressed.

* The marble method in the InkDrop class is responsible for detecting interactions between the ink drop and other elements (MultiCircles, Dots).
* It takes another object (e.g., a Dot or MultiCircle) as a parameter and checks if the distance between the ink drop and that object is less than the sum of their radii (this.radius + other.radius).
* If they are close enough (d < this.radius + other.radius), it calculates the angle to the other object and adjusts the ink drop's position (targetX and targetY) so that it looks like the ink is "marbling" around the other object.
* It then calculates the acceleration (ax and ay) towards the target position and creates a new Splash object at the ink drop's position with the calculated acceleration and color.
  

```
  marble(drop) {
    let d = dist(this.x, this.y, drop.x, drop.y); // Calculate distance to drop
    if (d < dotSize + drop.radius) {
      let angle = atan2(drop.y - this.y, drop.x - this.x); // Calculate angle to drop
      let targetX = this.x + cos(angle) * (dotSize + drop.radius); // Calculate target x
      let targetY = this.y + sin(angle) * (dotSize + drop.radius); // Calculate target y
      let ax = (targetX - drop.x) * 0.05; // Calculate x acceleration
      let ay = (targetY - drop.y) * 0.05; // Calculate y acceleration
      this.splashes.push(new Splash(this.x, this.y, ax, ay, color(193, 110, 74))); // Add splash
      return true; // Indicate that the drop hit the Dot
    }
    return false; // Indicate that the drop did not hit the Dot
  }

  tine(v, x, y, z, c) {
    this.splashes.push(new Splash(x, y, v.x * z, v.y * z, c)); // Add splash
  }

```
